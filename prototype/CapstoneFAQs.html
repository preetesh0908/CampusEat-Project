	<h2 align = "center"> How can I cancel an order after I place it? </h2>

	<p>Once you have placed the order, you can cancel the order by clicking on the "Cancel" button. If you have refreshed the page, or change the URL, you can only cancel it by calling us at CampusEAT. </p>
	
	  
	  <h2 align = "center"> How can I get a refund after I cancel the order? </h2>

	<p> If the order was paid through a credit/debit card or by PayPal, the refund would automatically be processed and be send back to the original form of payment, If the payment was made through iBucks, it'd again automatically be refunded in 1-2 business days</p>

	  <p> If there's a problem with your order, contact our Customer Care Team via chat or phone and let us know. Keep your order confirmation email or order details page handy for reference as we help you with your concerns. </p>
	
	  <h2 align = "center"> Can I place an order for delivery, instead of Pickup? </h2>
	  
	  <p> Unfortunately, we at CampusEAT only have the option for Pickup, and not delivery. </p>
	  
	  <h2 align = "center"> Is there a minimum amount that I have to place for an order? </h2>
	  
	  <p> Since we provide only Pickup facility, there is no minimum amount for an order! </p>
	  
	  <h2 align = "center"> Which payment method does CampusEat accept? </h2>
	  
	  <p> As of now, CampusEat only accepts credit/debit cards, Paypal, and iBucks as accepted form of payments. </p>
	  
	  <h2 align = "center"> Can I leave a review for my order? </h2>
	  
	  <p> Currently we do not have a review system based on orders, but if you'd like to leave a review, you can do so by filling our a Feedback Form on dining.rps.iu.edu or my sending an email to dining@iu.edu
